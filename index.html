        </p>
        <p>SlauTeams has helped the university to produce well trained graduates that have deeper knowledge 
            of what they have studied. This has been possible by allowing students server other students 
            through their selected teams. Some students have went on and started their businesses from scratch
            while still at campus and as soon as they graduate, they tend to focus on their businesses and 
            with help still from the SlauTeams, some businesses that were started by the members of SlauTeams 
            have been able to blossom into successful ventures. Thanks to Kintu Ha for his brilliant idea.
